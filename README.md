It is generally observed that planning a wedding is a very hectic and time consuming task, so we decided to automate the same. This website acts as an alternative to the wedding planner. We intend to create an interface that is easily usable by an end user who is not so acquainted with using web based applications or websites. The user can create an account and access it whenever required allowing them to organize their selections whenever they want from wherever they want, providing them with the highest control.

The fundamental principle behind this website is to automate menial tasks and provide an interface that feels just as natural to users without any substantial computer experience as it does to tech-savvy individuals. This is built from the ground-up while retaining scalability, reliability and end userâ€™s convenience as the foundation, based on the experience gathered by the group in this domain.

It solves the following problems:
- Unnecessary disagreements and problems occurring due to miscommunication between the client and planner.
- Reduces the chances of fraud.
- Saves the cost of a planner and provides better service.
- Best for people who prefer to do it their way.
